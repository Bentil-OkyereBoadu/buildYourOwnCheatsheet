                            <br>The z-index property uses integer values, which can be positive or negative values. The element with the highest z-index value will be at the foreground,
                            while the element with the lowest z-index value will be at the back.

                            <br>The CSS <em>position</em> can be set to <em>static, relative, absolute</em> or <em>fixed</em>. When the CSS position has value of <em>fixed</em>, it is set to a specific spot on a page.
                            <br>The fixed element stays the same regardless of scrolling. The navigation bar is a great example of an element that is often set to <em>position: fixed;</em>, enabling the user to scroll through the web page and still access the navigation bar.

                        <br><em>Block-level</em> elements take up the full width of their container with line breaks before and after, and can have their height and width manually adjusted.
                        <br><em>Inline</em> elements take uo as little space as possible, flow horizontally, and cannot have their width or height manually adjusted.
                        <br><em>Inline-block</em> elements can appear next to each other, and can have their width and height manually adjusted.

                        The <em>absolute</em> value removes an element entirely from the document flow.<br>
                        By using the positioning attributes <em>top, left, bottom</em> and <em>right</em>, an element can be positioned anywhere as expected.

                            The value <em>relative</em> of the CSS <em>position</em> property enables an element to be positioned relative to where it would have originally been on a web page.
                        <br>The offset properties can be used to determine the actual position of the element relative to its original position.
                        <br>Without the offset properties, this declaration will have no effect on its positioning, it will act as the default value <em>static</em> of the <em>position</em> property.

                        <br>The value <em>left</em> floats an element to the left side of its container and the value <em>right</em> floats an element to the right side of its container.
